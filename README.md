This road-map for android development that can help you to start creating applications.

##### Before we start providing you with resources..
## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What is the meaning of Android OS ?
![Android1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67293611/164342732-44e8d3cc-4c63-4b52-ba59-a9811ee96e2d.jpg)

#### Android is a Latin word meaning robot and it based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software.
### Designed for:

##### 1-Smartphone&Tabletüì≤üì±
##### 2-SmartTV üì∫
##### 3-Smartwatch ‚åö
##### 4-Other things like attched with IOT and AI üí≠ 
---------------------------------------------------------------
#### Now we can start in RoadMap first of all we should learn ( Java or Kotlin ) poragraming language then XML to bulid UI"User Interface"


## we recommend starting with java,but Why? ü§î

##### I-Most of the answers are open source, like StackOverflow, written in Java
##### II-Most of the open source projects written in java
##### III-There are many tutorials and problem solution for java
##### III-If you worked in a company and there was an application built using Java, how would you modify it when you did not know it?

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Learning Java

+ [Java 103](shorturl.at/hrsAI)

###### + [Mohamed El Desouky](shorturl.at/vwQ19)

##### Before moving to next level you should practice on some topics like Looping,Conditional structure,Array and OOP
#### GOahead and creat bank or hospital system

‚ö´‚ö™ Now you are ready to start with android

## beginner Level


#### Now you are ready to build UI using xml and write some java code at android studio.

##### what are you wating for? goahead and use every thing that you leant from this level

## Intermediate Level:

### There is a thing called recyclerview, so what is it?
##### It's one of the most indispensable things in Android because most of the applications need to display a List of elements and the best way to organize & handel these things is recyclerview

#### check this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw9JF55LDzE&list=PLrnPJCHvNZuBtTYUuc5Pyo4V7xZ2HNtf4)

## üòâThen you are ready for Database

### There are 2 types Local and remote first we will learn local and Later we will learn remote
### Local: We use shared preference and room database(based on sqllite).
### Remote: We can use firebase or some thing called API.

#### What is Database generally?üòï

#### üìã Resources:
#### simple [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR4QIeZaPeM&feature=youtu.be)
#### then start with learning sqllite commands before implement it with android studio:

#### üìã Resources:
#### ProgrammingKnowledge: [check](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS1QulWo1RIa0-Cs2Qx6GFyiIVVVS9lCS)


#### Learn how to store data into your local database of your application by learning room database.

#### Make sure you made your hands ditry with code from all levelsüòÖ


## Advanced Java

it's time to learn about networking basics 

### üìã Resources:
Android Basics: Networking 
1. [check this](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-networking--ud843)

 So now you need to learn about recycler view, fargments, notification, room database and working with some libraries and more..

## After that you should learn Retrofit.Okay,But what is this thing?
### Let me say Retrofit The best thing that happened in the history of Android
### Simply put, Retrofit is to support RESTful api architecture http network request framework encapsulation library, Retrofit encapsulates many custom annotations, which greatly facilitates and simplifies use, in addition to the flexibility is also higher, the bottom layer okhttp to achieve a real network request, it can be said that their relationship is a division of labor and cooperation. The summary is one sentence: Retrofit let okhttp network requests more elegant!

### Their relationship can be more easily understood by looking at the following figure:

### This step is optional, but highly recommended. We will learn to use Material Design if you want to know more about GoogleIt

:Go a head and build a project and use the tools that you learned:

##  Now my time comes "Kotlin"

![1_99YiKjwB2TliKVA-yGogNQ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67293611/164585376-c03ad8a8-c1a3-42f9-92e7-8357fe2186f5.png)
>- In 2010, JetBrains began developing this language, before the company announced it in 2011, and the language became officially open source in 2012                    In February 2016, the company announced the release of the first official version of Kotlin 1.0                                                                      Then, in May 2017, Google officially announced its official support for Kotlin as a first-class language at the developer conference, and it can be used to write Android applications using various platforms.

### Going to start with bascis Kotlin

## Before moving to Android with Kotlin make the same project java but in this time with Kotlin

## Now u can start Android with Kotlin,But shall I start from first?üò¢

### No,All you have to do is seeing applications written in kotlin and understand it well,watching playlists that make apps and some articals

## Some topics to GoogleItü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
+ Architecture pattern (MVVM, MVP, MVI).
+ SOLID Principles
+ customization of Retrofit.
+ Learn some design patterns.
+ Dependency injection
+ Kotlin coroutines.
+ Jetpack compose.
+ Security&Testing.

## Then I finshed?ü•±
### I think you are in the Middle of the right way keep learning and check all updates
